I graduated college with a chemical engineering degree and in my past life worked for many years in the semiconductor industry as an engineer and manager.

I soon realized that most of the small business owners who were my customers had neither the inclination nor the desire to use this software to create their own websites, so I began building the sites for them as a service.
