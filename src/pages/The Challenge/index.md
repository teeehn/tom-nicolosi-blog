The challenge is simple: Build 10 sites in 10 days. Ten in ten.

Why do this? Probably because I am crazy! There is no direct short term gain to be had from this other than the momentum it builds and the extra weight that is added to my current portfolio.

My portfolio is light because most of my recent efforts have been expended working for other people as part of a team. In that sense I can point to [my work as a whole](http://teeehn.github.io/work/), but I do not have a lot of individual sites that I have created as a freelancer that are still up and running. This is mostly because I have only done a few sites over the past few years while I have been working most of my time for others.

Another reason is that I need to get some work up on github. This is similar to the reason above, but also is another way to show my activity and create code samples. The github repos I have worked on have been private, so not much to show. All of the projects I have worked on as a freelancer are private in bitbucket, so again nothing I can show. This gives me code that is public.

Also I need a few things. I need a blog (hence this one) and I need to revise my main freelancer/business site. I want to use the later to sell my services and some products. I have a reseller site that is languishing and that I want to give one last effort to monetize.

Last but not least there are a few technologies that I want to dig deeper into. This blog for instance uses a static site generator that is built on React and GraphQl. I already know React, but I want to dive deeper and I want to learn GraphQl. Another area I want to explore is the use of a headless WordPress CMS with a React or even a static site (like Gatsby) front end.

That about covers it for now.
