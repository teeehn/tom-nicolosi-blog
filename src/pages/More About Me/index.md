My passion is working hands on to craft engaging websites and web applications, but web development is my second career. I graduated college with a chemical engineering degree and in my past life worked for many years in the semiconductor industry as an engineer and manager. My last position in that industry was at a small company that supplied equipment for manufacturing circuits on silicon wafers. The company failed financially during one of the many down cycles in that sector of the economy and I was let go. 

I live in Southern California and at the time I lost my job I had a young family to support. My options to remain in the same industry seemed narrow and would have required me to either move out of state or travel abroad extensively. I was determined to stay put where I loved, support my family, and learn something new.

I had always enjoyed working with computers and started my career in web development by selling a software package that included a primitive website builder. I soon realized that most of the small business owners who were my customers had neither the inclination nor the desire to use this software to create their own websites, so I began building the sites for them as a service. But building the websites solely with the site building software I sold was clunky, severely limited, and frustrating. To do a better job and make the websites more functional and attractive I realized that I needed to learn the underlying technology of the web. 

Over the next few years I taught myself how to code websites and web applications using HTML, CSS and JavaScript. I learned how to build and host websites using open source content management systems like WordPress. Eventually I took on a full-time position at a small digital marketing firm where I utilized my new skills and expanded my experience and skill set. 

Since then I have held several other positions in the web and software development  industry. Working in this area has fueled my desire to constantly learn and practice new skills in a fast moving and constantly evolving environment. As far as the work goes I seldom look back with nostalgia on my previous career.

It may seem like this has all gone great for me, but actually there have been a lot of stops and starts along the way. It turns out that in the long term I have not insulated myself from the ups and downs of the employment market by switching careers. It is just a different game now, but one I enjoy playing a lot more and with many more opportunities locally. I now even have the flexibility of working freelance or remotely from anyplace in the world with an Internet connection.

The down side of working in an ever changing and challenging industry is that you always need to be learning and practicing the latest technology. This is great for me because I love to learn and I tend to learn quickly, but at times it can seem overwhelming. 

There is also lots of competition in freelance development. The entry barrier is low for learning the basic skills a developer needs as most of the information is open source and freely available to anyone who has a computer along with the desire and time to learn.  You don’t need a special license and there isn’t a specific college degree you need in order to be successful. 

Added to that there are many options available to outsource work abroad using cheap freelancing services available on the web.  There are also several new services that make it easier than ever before for small business owners with the inclination to create their own sites. 

This all just drives me to work especially hard to make my services add value.
